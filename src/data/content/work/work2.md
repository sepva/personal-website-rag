Joined StartupXYZ as the third engineer, helping build a real-time collaboration platform for remote teams.

• Implemented real-time presence and collaborative editing
• Set up CI/CD pipeline and monitoring infrastructure

Growth:
During my time there, we grew from 3 to 25 engineers. I helped establish coding standards, interview processes, and technical onboarding.

This experience taught me how to move fast while building maintainable systems, and how to make critical architectural decisions with limited information.

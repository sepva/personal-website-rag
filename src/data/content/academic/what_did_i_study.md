# What did I study?

## In short...

*2020-2023*: Bachelor Civil Engineering at KU Leuven with minor in Electrical Engineering and major in Computer Science

*2023-2025*: Graduated magna cum laude as Master in Computer Science at KU Leuven with major in AI

## A bit longer...

In high-school I studied "Wetenschappen-Wiskunde 8u", which means I studied science and maths, with 8 hours of maths a week. I my last years of high-school I discovered the wonderful world of programming (in C#). Going to uni, I wanted to study either Civil Engineering or Physics. I didn't see myself doing a PhD or becoming a real scientist, so I chose Engineering. In my bachelor, I liked the computer science and AI courses the most, so I went on to do that for my master.

## Most influential courses

[Artificial Intelligence](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/n/H06U1AN): Big, in-depth overview of different fields of AI

[Principles of Machine Learning](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H0E98AE): Building upon the previous course, going more in-depth on Machine Learning methods 

[Natural Language Processing](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02B1AE): Great overview of all methods, building-blocks and algorithms in the recently hyped field of NLP

[Big Data Analytics Programming](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H00Y4AE): Hands-on course on how to handle and analyze big datasets

[Study of Declarative Languages](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/n/H04H5BN): Get to know a logical (Prolog) and functional (Haskell) programming language, which trigger a different kind of problem solving

## My Master Thesis

My master thesis was called "Personalisatie van humorgeneratie door Large Language Models'. So in short, I tried to combine a bunch of NLP techniques (Retrieval Augmented Generation, Best-of-N sampling, Supervised Fine-Tuning and Direct Preference Optimization) to generate jokes that fit the humor preferences of a certain user. If you want to learn more about this, my thesis text is on my [Github](https://github.com/sepva/thesis_text) and I am working on publishing a shorter paper on the same topic.

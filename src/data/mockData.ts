    fullContent: `This project started from a fascination with how tools like Figma and Google Docs handle real-time collaboration. I wanted to understand the underlying technology and build something similar from scratch.

The core challenge was implementing Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to ensure that concurrent edits from multiple users would converge to the same state without conflicts. I used Yjs for the CRDT implementation and integrated it with a custom WebSocket server.

Key features:
• Live cursor positions and selections for all connected users
• Operational transformation for text edits
• Syntax highlighting for 20+ programming languages
• Presence indicators showing who's currently viewing the document
• Auto-save with version history

Technical stack: React, TypeScript, Yjs, WebSocket, Monaco Editor, Node.js

The most interesting technical challenge was optimizing the WebSocket connection to handle hundreds of concurrent users without degrading performance. I implemented connection pooling and message batching to reduce bandwidth usage by 60%.`

    fullContent: `An exploration into artistic machine learning, this app lets users transform their photos using pre-trained neural style transfer models.

I was inspired by the famous Neural Style Transfer paper by Gatys et al., and wanted to make this technology accessible in the browser. The app runs entirely client-side using TensorFlow.js, meaning users' photos never leave their device.

Implementation details:
• Used pre-trained MobileNetV2 as the base model
• Implemented custom training pipeline for style models
• Optimized for mobile devices with model quantization
• Progressive Web App with offline support
• Real-time preview with adjustable style strength

The biggest challenge was achieving acceptable performance on mobile devices. I reduced model size by 70% through quantization and implemented a progressive rendering approach that shows a low-res preview first.`

Architecture:
• Celery workers distributed across multiple containers
• Redis as the message broker and result backend
• Flower for monitoring and administration
• Custom priority queue implementation
• Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff

Performance metrics:
• Processing 10,000+ tasks per minute
• 99.9% success rate with retry logic
• Average latency under 100ms
• Horizontal scaling across 20+ workers

This system reduced our batch processing time from hours to minutes and made real-time features possible that weren't feasible before.`

    tags: ['React', 'Next.js', 'Web Development'],
    type: 'blog' as const,
    date: 'April 2024',
    fullContent: `React Server Components represent a fundamental shift in how we think about rendering in React applications. This post explores the mental model and practical implications.

What are Server Components?
Server Components are React components that run exclusively on the server. They never ship to the client, which means they can access backend resources directly without an API layer.

Key Benefits:
1. Zero bundle size - Server Components don't add to your JavaScript bundle
2. Direct backend access - Query databases, read files, access secrets
3. Automatic code splitting - Only Client Components are bundled
4. Better performance - Less JavaScript to download and parse

The distinction between Server and Client Components requires a new mental model. Server Components are great for data fetching and rendering static content, while Client Components handle interactivity and browser APIs.

Practical Example:
Instead of fetching data in useEffect on the client, Server Components let you fetch during render on the server. This eliminates loading states and improves perceived performance.

The future of React is hybrid - using Server Components for the static shell and Client Components for interactive elements. This combination gives us the best of both worlds.`

    type: 'blog' as const,
    date: 'February 2024',
    fullContent: `Accessibility is often treated as a checklist item, but building truly accessible UIs requires understanding how people with disabilities actually use the web.

Keyboard Navigation:
Every interactive element should be keyboard accessible. This means proper focus management, visible focus indicators, and logical tab order. I use the tab key exclusively for a day when testing new features.

Screen Reader Considerations:
ARIA labels are a start, but semantic HTML is better. Use <button> instead of <div onclick>. Use <nav> for navigation. Screen readers rely on these semantic landmarks.

Real-world Examples:
• Modal dialogs should trap focus and restore it on close
• Loading states need aria-live regions
• Form errors should be announced immediately
• Skip links help keyboard users bypass repetitive content

Testing Tools:
• NVDA or JAWS for screen reader testing
• Axe DevTools for automated checks
• Keyboard-only navigation testing
• Color contrast analyzers

Accessibility isn't about compliance - it's about ensuring everyone can use what we build. Start with semantic HTML, test with actual assistive technologies, and always think about the full spectrum of users.`

• Analyzed existing LLVM RISC-V backend
• Identified optimization opportunities
• Implemented custom instruction patterns
• Benchmarked against standard compilation
